# Under active development

### Cybersecurity game

A simple game that tests the knowledge of the player in cybersecurity through a card-game based gameplay system, where if either one of the two sides- the computer imposing as a hacker, and the player; loses all their health first, they lose.

### Features

* Simple game mechanics that can be understood by anyone.
* Built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript that allows easy compatibility with any device or OS.

### To be implemented

* Proper login system- a base login page is in place however there is not support for logging in as a local user or through other services via OAuth.
* Player progression system.
* Porting into an app using Electron for desktop and native tools for mobile systems.

### Installation/Execution

__NOTE: Currently there are issues getting the code to run within Electron. This will be fixed soon.__

#### Zip file:
    1. Click the green `Code` button and select `Download ZIP`. This downloads a compressed zip file with the repository name as the filename(Future releases will have proper executable files for Windows, macOS and Linux systems)
    2. Once downloaded, navigate to the target folder and right click on the file. Then select the respective option to extract the files.
    3. After extraction, open the `index.html` file within your web browser of choice. As this is standard web code, it will work on any browser.
#### Cloning the repository:
    1. Make sure you have `Git` installed on your system. In your command line interface(CMD/Powershell/Terminal on Windows and your default terminal emulator in macOS/Linux/*nix), navigate to the folder you want to use to say the files, say the Downloads folder with the command `cd Downloads`.
    2. Copy the URL of the repository and type the following command:
    `git clone https://github.com/sid3425/Cybersecurity-Game`
    3. The repository is now cloned to the respective folder. Follow the same instructions as the Zip file method from step 2 mentioned above.
    
#### Ways to run the file:
    1. Directly opening in the browser: Some systems will directly open the `index.html` file within your default web browser when double clicked on. However you can also right click on the file and use the `Open with` option to open it within the browser, or inside your browser use `Ctrl+O`(if you use a Windows layout keyboard) or `Cmd+O`(if you use a Mac layout keyboard), and within the window that pops up select the `index.html` file.
    2. Using Live Server(Requires Visual Studio Code): Install the Live Server extension from VSCode. Then open the `index.html` file and on the right side of the bottom bar you will see an option called `Go Live`. Click on it and it launches a small server instance and opens the file as if it is a website, with the address `https://127.0.0.1:5000`. To stop it you can either click the same button or close VSCode.
