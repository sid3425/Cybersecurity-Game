        <h1>Rules of H@CK4R Z0NE</h1>
        <p>The objective of the game is to defeat the hacker by reducing their health to 0 or below. You do this by selecting the correct card to counter the hacker's attack.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <p>Each round, the hacker will present an attack card with a power level. You have three defense cards to choose from, each with its own power level.</p>
            <p>Select the defense card you believe is the strongest counter to the hacker's attack.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If your chosen card's power level is HIGHER than the hacker's, you deal damage equal to the difference to the hacker. You successfully defended the attack!</li>
                <li>If your chosen card's power level is LOWER than the hacker's, the hacker deals damage equal to the difference to you. You were hacked!</li>
                <li>If the power levels are equal, it's a tie, and no damage is dealt.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Winning and Losing</h2>
            <p>The game continues until either your health or the hacker's health reaches 0 or below.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If the hacker's health reaches 0 or below first, you win!</li>
                <li>If your health reaches 0 or below first, you lose.</li>
            </ul>
